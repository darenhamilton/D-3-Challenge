# D-3-Challenge
This project is to create a data visualization a 2014 ACS 1-year estimates data set using  D3.
Using D3 techniques I created a statter plot that represents each State with a circle element.
The State abbreviation appears in the circles and I used the tool tip fuction to create a click event 
that will display the State Name and details for each circle.
